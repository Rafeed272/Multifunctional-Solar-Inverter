# Multifunctional-Solar-Inverter
This project develops a solar-powered inverter system that stores energy for nighttime or transportation use. A boost converter stabilizes voltage, ensuring consistent performance even with varying sunlight. It powers small appliances like chargers and lamps, with scalability for larger devices, promoting renewable energy adoption in rural areas.
